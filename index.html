            We provide front-end challenges that include professional web
            designs. These allow you to practice building websites in a
            realistic workflow. Taking these challenges will help you improve
            your skills, gain experience creating websites, and build up an
            incredible project portfolio. We also have a large community of
            developers, so it's a great way to meet other devs!

            Is Frontend Mentor free?
          </summary>
          <p class="accordion-details-answer">
            The majority of our challenges are free, yes. We do have some that
            are premium and require a Pro subscription to access. It will say on
            each challenge whether they are free or premium, so it's easy to
            tell the difference.

            The best (and quickest) way to get help on a challenge is in our
            Discord server. There are thousands of other developers in there, so
            it's a great place to ask questions. We even have a dedicated "help"
            channel! If you haven't joined yet, you can get an invite to our
            Discord server here.mi?
